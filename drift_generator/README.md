Drift generator:



The drift generator select plans from a pool of plans generated by the planner. And it will return a series of plans (as observations) in a pattern of drift.



To run the python script `drift_generator.py`, a few parameters need to be specified:



\1. Input: sets of plans, multiple sets of plans for all the modified environments and the original environment for all the goal candidates in each environment.

\2. Options: 



`-Sudden`: number of observations for each environment



`-Gradual`: 1. number of observations for each environment in the stable periods; 2. number of observations in the gradual changing period.



`-Incremental`: 1. number of observations for each environment in the stable periods; 2. the intermediate stages.



`-Reoccurring`: 1. number of observations for each environment in the stable periods; 2. number of reoccurance (times of repeat).



`-outlier`: the probability of outlier (environmental change) happens.







Examples of command:



\```sh

\# python drift_generator.py <option> <associate_param1> <associate_param2>

\```
